# The Positivity Journal - User Guide

Welcome to **The Positivity Journal**, a mindful application designed to help you build habits of positive thinking through gratitude and cognitive reframing.

## Core Features

### 1. Daily Gratitude ("Three Good Things")
This exercise is based on positive psychology research. By identifying three things that went well each day, you train your brain to scan the world for positivity.

**How to use:**
1.  Navigate to the **Today's Entry** tab (Pen icon).
2.  Reflect on your day.
3.  Write down **three specific things** that happened today that you are grateful for or that went well.
4.  Click **Save Entry**.
5.  **AI Analysis**: The app will analyze your entry to identify your dominant positive emotion and provide a personalized supportive insight.

### 2. Cognitive Reframing ("Shift Perspective")
This tool helps you practice **Cognitive Reframing**, a technique to change the way you view challenging situations. Instead of spiraling into negativity, you actively look for constructive viewpoints.

**How to use:**
1.  Navigate to the **Shift Perspective** tab (Refresh/Loop icon).
2.  **Step 1 (The Challenge):** Describe a situation that is stressing you out or a negative thought you are having. Click "Find New Perspectives".
3.  **Step 2 (The Choice):** The AI will generate three distinct ways to view this situation:
    *   **Growth:** Focuses on learning and resilience.
    *   **Curiosity:** Turns judgment and fear into wonder ("I wonder why...", "What if...").
    *   **Optimism:** Focuses on the silver lining or the bigger picture.
4.  **Step 3 (Internalize):** Click on the perspective that resonates with you. You can edit the text to make it personal.
5.  Click **Embrace Perspective** to save it to your journal.

### 3. History & Reflection
Reviewing your past entries is key to reinforcing positive memories and successful mindset shifts.

**How to use:**
1.  Navigate to the **History** tab (Book icon).
2.  Scroll to see a timeline of your journey.
    *   **Gratitude Entries** appear on white cards.
    *   **Reframe Entries** appear on gradient cards, showing both the original challenge (in red) and your new perspective (in green).

### 4. Insights & Progress
Track your consistency and emotional trends.

**How to use:**
1.  Navigate to the **Insights** tab (Chart icon).
2.  **Streak:** See how many consecutive days you have journaled.
3.  **Emotional Landscape:** A chart showing the distribution of emotions (e.g., Joyful, Peaceful, Resilient) across your entries.

## Tips for Success
*   **Be Specific:** Instead of "Lunch was good," write "I really enjoyed the spicy ramen I had for lunch and the conversation with my colleague."
*   **Consistency:** Try to journal at the same time every day, such as right before bed.
*   **Honesty:** It's okay to feel negative emotions. Use the "Shift Perspective" tool to process them constructively rather than suppressing them.
